    - promotion of diversity movements (BLM, anti-sexism)

Cool Japan policy..uncool and ineffective

- Opportunistic policy to enhance Japan's image in the world
    - one-way image projection, not promoting mutuality, by disseminating globally appealing "national" cultures
    - unengaged with the enhancement of creativity & the improvement of labor conditions
    - neglecting significant cultural questions
- Cultural complexity neglected
    - different kinds of politicization of culture and engagement with power
    - sub/cultural politics, negotiation and resistance obscured by the focus on "national form" and the promotion of "nation branding" and "soft power"
    - dynamic process of cultural flows & connections under uneven de/re-centering globalization processes
- Dialogic potentials of media culture connections
    - depending/complicating the understanding of Japan and Korea
    - self-reflexive rethinking of one's own identity, life, society and historically constituted relationships
    - mutuality and dialogue beyond "I love Japan"?
    - overcoming=obscuring historical issues?
    - Inter-nationalized promotion of cultural diversity?
        - diversity within borders disregarded/discouraged?
    

Nation branding & re-nationalization

- External projection & internal governance
    - "branding reinterprets national identity in market terms and provide new narratives for domestic consumption"(Jansen, 2008)
    - "the mundane practices of nation branding serve to perpetuate the nation form... Because they perpetuate a conversation about what the nation is *for* in a global context"
- Commercial nationalism
    - reproduction of nationalism in market terms through a paired advancement
    

Imploding Cool Japan to advance cultural policy proper

- critical studies of media culture : cultural complexities and cross-border dialogue under uneven globalization processes
- re-orienting cultural policy
    - cultural citizenship diplomacy : promoting greater mutuality & engaging with domestic publics
        - not just know about "others" but unlearn about "ourselves" & "self-other" relations
    - national interest beyond narrowly focused goals
        - national interests cannot be sustainably enhanced with unless they serve wider public interests domestically and internationally
- engaging with diversity
    - beyond business-drive inter-national promotion of diversity that does not engage with structured inequality and discrimination
    - representation/consumption of "diversity"
- designing public pedagogy
- beyond the object of research, into collaborative intervention towards the democratizing uses of media/otaku culture
